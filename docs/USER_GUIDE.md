## What is my-career-board?

my-career-board (Personal Career Governance System) treats your career like a company - with you as the CEO reporting to a board of directors.

> **Inspired by Nate Jones:**
> - Video: ["Most People Want Validation, Not Perspective (Why This Matters Now)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaC5FEN2e4Y)
> - Article: ["My honest field notes on being my own unreliable narrator"](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-rarest-thing-in-work-why-360)

Unlike a real board, these AI directors are:

- **Always available** - no scheduling needed
- **Brutally honest** - no politics or hidden agendas
- **Focused on you** - they know your specific challenges
- **Persistent** - they remember what you said and hold you accountable

### The Core Idea

Most career advice is generic. my-career-board is personalized to YOUR specific situation:

1. **You define your problems** - What are you actually paid to solve?
2. **AI directors challenge you** - Are you avoiding hard truths?
3. **You make commitments** - What will you do this quarter?
4. **The system tracks accountability** - Did you do what you said?

### Key Features

| Feature | Purpose | Time Required |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Problem Portfolio** | Define what you're paid to solve | 15-20 min (one-time) |
| **Quick Audit** | Fast accountability check | 15 min |
| **Board Meeting** | Deep quarterly review | 45-60 min |
| **Session History** | Review past discussions | 5 min |
| **Pattern Detection** | Spot recurring avoidance | Automatic |

## Setting Up Your Problem Portfolio

Your Problem Portfolio is the foundation of my-career-board. It defines what you're actually paid to solve, which allows the AI directors to give you relevant, personalized feedback.

### What is a "Problem"?

A problem isn't a task or project - it's an ongoing challenge you're responsible for. Good examples:

| Good Problems | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| "Scaling our data pipeline to handle 10x growth" | Ongoing challenge with clear stakes |
| "Building a high-performing engineering team" | Continuous responsibility |
| "Reducing customer churn below 5%" | Measurable goal with ongoing effort |
| "Navigating the transition from IC to manager" | Career development challenge |

| Bad Problems | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| "Finish the Q1 report" | This is a task, not an ongoing problem |
| "Be a better employee" | Too vague to be actionable |
| "Meetings" | Not a problem you're solving |

### The Setup Process

**Step 1: Introduction**
Read the overview and click "Next"

**Step 2: Define Your Problems**

For each problem (minimum 3, maximum 5), provide:

1. **Problem Name** (required)
   - Short, descriptive title
   - Example: "AI-powered customer support"

2. **What Breaks If You Ignore This?** (required)
   - The consequences of neglecting this problem
   - Be specific about impact
   - Example: "Response times increase, customer satisfaction drops, support costs rise as we need more human agents"

3. **Time Allocation** (optional)
   - Percentage of your work time spent on this
   - All problems should add up to roughly 100%

**Step 3: Classify Each Problem**

For each problem, answer 3 questions:

1. **Is AI making this problem cheaper to solve?**
   - Yes = AI is helping
   - No = Still requires human expertise

2. **How costly is it when errors occur?**
   - High = Mistakes are very expensive (data loss, legal issues)
   - Low = Errors are easily corrected

3. **How much trust is required?**
   - High = Clients/stakeholders must trust you personally
   - Low = Results speak for themselves

Based on your answers, the system classifies each problem:

| Classification | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| **Appreciating** | Your skills are becoming MORE valuable. AI isn't replacing this. |
| **Depreciating** | AI is making this cheaper. Your skills may become less valuable. |
| **Stable** | Holding steady. Neither gaining nor losing value. |
| **Uncertain** | Can't determine yet. Watch this space. |

**Step 4: Review & Save**

Review all your problems and their classifications, then click "Save Portfolio".

### Editing Your Portfolio

You can always update your portfolio:
1. Go to Dashboard → Problem Portfolio
2. Click "Add Problem" to add more
3. (Future feature: Edit existing problems)

## Running a Quick Audit

A Quick Audit is a 15-minute accountability check. It's less intensive than a full board meeting but keeps you honest between quarters.

### Starting a Quick Audit

1. From your Dashboard, click **"Start Audit"** on the blue Quick Audit card
2. The audit will begin immediately

### The Audit Process

You'll be asked a series of questions. For each question:

1. **Read the question carefully**
2. **Type your honest response**
3. **Be specific** - vague answers will be challenged

### Specificity Gates

The system includes "specificity gates" - if your answer is too vague, you'll be challenged to be more specific.

**Example:**

> **Question:** What's one thing you've been avoiding?
>
> **Vague answer:** "Having a difficult conversation"
>
> **Gate response:** "With who? About what? Be specific - who, what, when."

The gate helps you get past surface-level responses to the real issues.

### Audit Questions

Typical audit questions include:
- What's one thing you've been avoiding this week?
- What commitment did you make but not keep?
- What hard truth are you not acknowledging?
- What's the most important thing you should do but won't?
- If you got fired tomorrow, what would you wish you had done?

### Completing the Audit

After answering all questions:
1. Your responses are saved automatically
2. You can view the transcript in History
3. Patterns from this audit contribute to pattern detection

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: Recommended schedule:
- Quick Audit: Weekly or bi-weekly

A: Currently, you can view your history but bulk deletion is not yet implemented. This feature is planned for a future update.
