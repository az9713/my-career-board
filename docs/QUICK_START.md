### Step 2: Define Your Problems

Click **"Set Up Portfolio"** on the yellow card.

#### Define Problem 1

**Name:** `Leading the platform migration`

**What breaks if you ignore this?**
```
The legacy system becomes increasingly unstable, downtime increases,
development velocity slows as engineers work around old limitations,
and we lose competitive ground to companies on modern platforms.
```

**Time Allocation:** `40%`

#### Define Problem 2

**Name:** `Building and retaining my engineering team`

**What breaks if you ignore this?**
```
Key engineers leave for better opportunities, knowledge walks out
the door, remaining team gets overworked, project timelines slip,
and hiring becomes harder as word spreads about the culture.
```

**Time Allocation:** `35%`

#### Define Problem 3

**Name:** `Establishing myself as a technical leader`

**What breaks if you ignore this?**
```
I stay invisible to leadership, get passed over for promotion,
don't build the network I need for career growth, and miss
opportunities to influence important technical decisions.
```

**Time Allocation:** `25%`

#### Classify Each Problem

Answer the 3 questions for each problem:

| Problem | AI Cheaper? | Error Cost | Trust Required | Result |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Platform migration | No | High | High | **Appreciating** |
| Building team | No | Medium | High | **Appreciating** |
| Technical leadership | No | Low | High | **Stable** |

Click **"Save Portfolio"**

✅ **Your portfolio is set up! You can now access all features.**

---

### Step 3: Run Your First Quick Audit

1. Return to Dashboard
2. Click **"Start Audit"** on the blue card

#### Sample Audit Conversation

**Question 1:**
> What's one thing you've been avoiding this week?

**Your response:**
```
I've been avoiding the conversation with Mike about his declining
code quality. His PRs have had issues 3 weeks in a row and I keep
reviewing them myself instead of addressing it directly with him.
```

**Question 2:**
> What commitment did you make but didn't keep?

**Your response:**
```
I promised the team I'd finalize the migration timeline by last
Friday. I didn't. I've been "still gathering information" but
really I'm afraid to commit to dates I might miss.
```

**Question 3:**
> What hard truth are you not acknowledging?

**Your response:**
```
The migration is going to take 6 months longer than I told
leadership. I've known this for a month but haven't updated
anyone because I'm afraid of looking incompetent.
```

✅ **You've completed your first accountability session!**

## 10 Educational Use Cases

These real-world scenarios show you how to use my-career-board effectively.

---

### Use Case 1: First-Time Career Audit

**Situation:** You've never formally reflected on your career problems.

**What to do:**
1. Go to Portfolio Setup
2. List what actually takes up your time
3. Be honest about what breaks if you fail

**Example problems to define:**
- "Delivering projects on time and on budget"
- "Managing my stakeholders' expectations"
- "Developing my technical skills"

**What you'll learn:**
- Where you actually spend your time vs. where you think you spend it
- Which problems are truly yours vs. inherited from others
- Your implicit career priorities

---

### Use Case 2: Pre-Performance Review Prep

**Situation:** Your annual review is next week.

**What to do:**
1. Run a Quick Audit
2. Focus on concrete achievements
3. Identify your weak points before your manager does

**Sample audit responses:**

> **What did you accomplish this quarter?**
> "Led the migration of 3 microservices, reduced deployment time by 40%, mentored two junior engineers who are now operating independently."

> **What should you have done but didn't?**
> "I should have had the compensation conversation 3 months ago. I've been waiting for 'the right time' which never came."

**What you'll learn:**
- Your talking points for the review
- Gaps to address proactively
- How to frame challenges as growth opportunities

---

### Use Case 3: Quarterly Goal Setting

**Situation:** It's Q1 and you want to set meaningful goals.

**What to do:**
1. Start a Board Meeting
2. Focus on the "Next Quarter Bets" phase
3. Make goals falsifiable

**Sample board meeting exchange:**

> **Devil's Advocate:** What are your bets for next quarter? Make them falsifiable.

> **You:** "I will complete Phase 1 of the migration by March 31, as measured by all 5 services running in production on the new platform."

> **Devil's Advocate:** How will you know if you were wrong?

> **You:** "If by March 31 we have fewer than 5 services in production, or if we have rollback events, I was wrong about the timeline or approach."

**What you'll learn:**
- How to set goals that can actually be evaluated
- What success and failure actually look like
- Commitment vs. aspiration

---

### Use Case 4: Dealing with Difficult Colleagues

**Situation:** You have a conflict with a coworker you've been avoiding.

**What to do:**
1. Run a Quick Audit
2. The Avoidance Hunter will probe this

**Sample exchange:**

> **Avoidance Hunter:** What conversation have you been avoiding?

> **You:** "I need to talk to Jennifer about taking credit for my work in meetings."

> **Avoidance Hunter:** What specifically happened? With who present? What did she say exactly?

> **You:** "In last Tuesday's leadership sync, she presented my analysis of the customer churn problem as her own work. VP of Product and CTO were present. She said 'I've been analyzing our churn data...'"

> **Avoidance Hunter:** What would happen if you addressed this directly with her?

> **You:** "She might get defensive. It could damage our working relationship. But the alternative is continuing to be invisible while she advances using my work."

**What you'll learn:**
- The specific details that make the issue addressable
- What you're actually afraid of
- The cost of continued avoidance

---

### Use Case 5: Evaluating a Job Offer

**Situation:** You've received an offer from another company.

**What to do:**
1. Start a Board Meeting
2. Focus on Strategy Review phase

**Sample board meeting exchange:**

> **Strategist:** Where is your current path leading in 5 years?

> **You:** "At my current company, I'm on track to become a Staff Engineer in 2-3 years. The new offer is for a Senior position at a fast-growing startup with potential for rapid advancement."

> **Strategist:** Are you playing the right game?

> **You:** "The startup offers more ownership but less stability. My current path is safer but slower. The real question is whether I want stability or acceleration at this career stage."

> **Market Reality Skeptic:** What's the market evidence for each path?

> **You:** "Staff Engineers at established companies earn $250-300k. Startup equity is a lottery ticket. But successful startup executives can earn 10x that."

**What you'll learn:**
- How to evaluate opportunities beyond just compensation
- What you actually value in your career
- The trade-offs you're making implicitly

---

### Use Case 6: Preparing for a Difficult Conversation

**Situation:** You need to ask for a raise.

**What to do:**
1. Run a Quick Audit
2. Focus on gathering evidence

**Sample exchange:**

> **Market Reality Skeptic:** What evidence shows you're worth more?

> **You:** "I led the migration that saved $2M annually. I've been promoted once but my salary hasn't caught up to market rate."

> **Accountability Hawk:** What exactly will you ask for?

> **You:** "A 15% raise to bring me to the median for my role in this market."

> **Accountability Hawk:** When will you have this conversation?

> **You:** "I will schedule a 1:1 with my manager by this Friday to discuss compensation."

**What you'll learn:**
- How to build an evidence-based case
- How to commit to a specific action
- How to frame the ask

---

### Use Case 7: Weekly Accountability Check

**Situation:** You want to stay on track between major reviews.

**What to do:**
1. Run a Quick Audit every Friday
2. Keep it focused on the past week

**Sample weekly audit:**

> **Question:** What did you avoid this week?

> **You:** "I avoided giving Maria feedback on her presentation. It wasn't good but I just said 'nice job' to avoid awkwardness."

> **Question:** What will you do differently next week?

> **You:** "I will schedule a 30-minute feedback session with Maria by Tuesday and give specific, actionable feedback on structure and delivery."

**What you'll learn:**
- Patterns in your avoidance behavior
- How small weekly actions prevent big quarterly problems
- Building the habit of accountability

---

### Use Case 8: Post-Project Retrospective

**Situation:** A major project just finished (well or poorly).

**What to do:**
1. Start a Board Meeting
2. Focus on Last Quarter Review phase

**Sample exchange (project went poorly):**

> **Accountability Hawk:** What were your specific bets for this project?

> **You:** "I bet that we could complete the integration in 6 weeks with 3 engineers."

> **Accountability Hawk:** Were you right or wrong? What's the evidence?

> **You:** "I was wrong. It took 10 weeks and 5 engineers. The evidence is the timeline and the resource requests I had to make."

> **Accountability Hawk:** Why were you wrong?

> **You:** "I underestimated the complexity of the legacy API. I assumed documentation was accurate. I should have allocated 2 weeks for discovery before committing to timelines."

**What you'll learn:**
- Root causes of project issues
- Patterns in your estimation errors
- How to improve future predictions

---

### Use Case 9: Career Transition Planning

**Situation:** You want to move from IC to management.

**What to do:**
1. Update your Portfolio to reflect the transition
2. Start a Board Meeting
3. Focus on Strategy and Market Check

**Sample problem to add:**
```
Name: "Transitioning from IC to manager"

What breaks: "I stay stuck in IC roles while my peers advance into
leadership. I don't develop the skills to lead larger initiatives.
I become a highly-paid individual contributor with limited upside."
```

**Sample board meeting exchange:**

> **Strategist:** Is this the right game to be playing?

> **You:** "I'm not sure. I love the technical work, but IC paths seem to plateau. Management could open more doors but might take me away from what I'm good at."

> **Market Reality Skeptic:** What's the market reality for ICs vs. managers at your level?

> **You:** "Principal Engineers can earn as much as Directors. But there are 10x more Director positions. The management path has more optionality."

**What you'll learn:**
- Whether your career transition is well-reasoned
- What you'd be giving up
- What skills you need to develop

---

### Use Case 10: Breaking a Recurring Pattern

**Situation:** The same issue keeps appearing in your sessions.

**What to do:**
1. Review your History for patterns
2. Start a Board Meeting specifically to address it

**Example pattern:** "Avoiding confrontation" appears in 4 of your last 5 sessions.

**Sample exchange:**

> **Avoidance Hunter:** Your pattern detection shows you consistently avoid confrontation. What's the root cause?

> **You:** "I grew up in a household where conflict meant yelling and days of silence. I learned to avoid it at all costs."

> **Avoidance Hunter:** What's avoiding confrontation costing you professionally?

> **You:** "I don't address performance issues until they're crises. I let people take credit for my work. I don't negotiate hard enough on compensation."

> **Avoidance Hunter:** What's one confrontation you will have this week?

> **You:** "I will give direct feedback to my team member about missed deadlines by Thursday. I will specifically say 'The last 3 deliverables were late, and this is affecting the team.'"

**What you'll learn:**
- How patterns connect to your history
- The professional cost of personal patterns
- How to break the cycle with specific actions

## Common Patterns to Watch For

After a few sessions, watch for these patterns:

| Pattern | What It Means | What to Do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| "Difficult conversations" recurring | You're avoiding interpersonal conflict | Schedule one difficult conversation this week |
| "Compensation" recurring | You feel undervalued but aren't acting | Gather market data and make the ask |
| "Time management" recurring | You're overcommitted | Cut 20% of your commitments |
| "Career growth" recurring | You're not taking career ownership | Define and pursue one growth goal |
| "Work-life balance" recurring | Sustainable pace is unsustainable | Set boundaries and enforce them |
